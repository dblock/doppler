## Artists API

An artist creates [artworks](/docs/artworks).

An artist is generally one person, but can also be two people collaborating, a collective of people, or even a mysterious entity such as "Banksy".

#### Retrieving Artists

Retrieve artists by following the [artists](#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}/artists) link from [root](#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}).

```
curl -v "#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}/artists" -H "X-XAPP-Token:#{xapp_token}"
```

The response is a [paginated result](/docs/pagination) with embedded artists.

``` json
{
  "total_count" : 1,
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}/artists"
    },
    "next" : {
      "href" : "#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}/artists?cursor=..."
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "artists" : [
      {
        "id" : "...",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Retrieving an Artist

Users can retrieve a specific artist by ID by rendering the "artist" link template from [root](#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}).

```
curl -v "#{ArtsyAPI.artsy_api_root}/artists/#{id}" -H "X-XAPP-Token:#{xapp_token}"
```
